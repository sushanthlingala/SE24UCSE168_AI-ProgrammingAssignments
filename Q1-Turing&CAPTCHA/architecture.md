# Turing Test & CAPTCHA Implementation and Architecture

---

## 1. Turing Test

The Turing Test involves a human judge exchanging text messages with two invisible respondents, one human and one machine. The task for the judge is to identify which is which. If the machine cannot be identified as a machine, it is said to have passed the Turing Test.

### Capabilities Required

For a machine to pass, it must demonstrate:

- **Natural language processing** to communicate in any natural language
- **Knowledge representation** to store what it knows and perceives
- **Automated reasoning** to answer questions and draw conclusions
- **Machine learning** to 'learn' and be able to understand patterns and extrapolate them

### Proposed Architecture

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Respondent Interface | Defines method of input |
| Human Respondent | Human responses via I/O |
| Machine Respondent | AI system generating responses |
| Interrogator/Judge | Asks questions and evaluates responses |
| Session Manager | Manages conversation flow |

         +-------------------+
                   |
                   v
         +------------------+
         |  Session Manager |
         |  Controls Turns  |
         +------------------+

## 2. CAPTCHA

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) inverts the Turing Test. Here, the system is the judge, and the goal is to verify that the respondent is human by posing challenges that are easy for humans but hard for machines.

### Challenge Types

- **Distorted text** containing characters with visual noise that OCR systems struggle to parse
- **Arithmetic** like simple sums that require basic understanding
- **Logic / common-sense** questions requiring world knowledge
- **Image recognition**, such as selecting images matching a label, difficult for early vision systems

### Proposed Architecture

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Challenge Generator | Generates CAPTCHA challenges and applies distortion where required |
| Challenge Validator | Compares user input with correct answer |
| Session Manager | Tracks attempts, imposes retry limits, and locks session when necessary |
| UI / Renderer | Displays CAPTCHA and collects user input |

### Flowchart

         v
  Access Granted / Locked
```
